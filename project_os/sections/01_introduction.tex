\subsection{Problem statement}
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a core capability for mobile robots.
However, SLAM performance is sensitive to real-time constraints: delayed sensor processing or dropped messages can degrade mapping quality and localization accuracy.
This project builds a full ROS 2 simulation pipeline and measures how CPU contention affects:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item LiDAR scan throughput \topic{/scan} (rate and jitter),
  \item Map publishing \topic{/map} (rate and jitter),
  \item CPU utilization of key nodes (slam\_toolbox, ros\_gz\_bridge, cpu\_hog).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item A ROS 2 workspace integrating TurtleBot3 simulation, SLAM Toolbox, and a reactive explorer node.
  \item A metrics runner that schedules CPU loads and logs topic timing statistics and CPU usage over time.
  \item An OS-focused analysis of contention, scheduling effects, and how resource policies can impact SLAM.
\end{itemize}
