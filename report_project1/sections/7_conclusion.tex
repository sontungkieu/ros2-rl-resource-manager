\section{Conclusion}
I have completed building the Robotics development environment on WSL with ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic. Issues regarding installation, environment variable configuration, and user privileges have been thoroughly resolved. The system is now capable of physical simulation, robot control, and stable sensor data acquisition, ready for more complex tasks in the subsequent phases.
