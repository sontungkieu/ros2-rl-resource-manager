\section{Introduction}
In the initial phase of Project 1, I focused on establishing the necessary software infrastructure for Robotics research. This report details the successful deployment of the Robot Operating System 2 (Version: Jazzy Jalisco) and the Gazebo Harmonic physics simulator on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) platform. Additionally, this report records experimental results regarding the control of the TurtleBot3 robot and the visualization of LaserScan sensor data within the simulated environment.
